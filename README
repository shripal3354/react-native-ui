UI Kitten is a React Native implementation of Eva Design System. It contains a set of general purpose UI components styled in a similar way. You focus on business logic and the Kitten takes care of visual appearance. And the most awesome thing: the themes can be changed in the runtime, without any need of reloading the application.
